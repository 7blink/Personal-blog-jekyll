![Game Image](/images/Post4-1.png)This is a small platform game I made about a year ago.  The object is to move the little green guy and have him jump on the enemies.  It was built using free images from [open game art](http://opengameart.org/) and built on the Quintus javascript framework.  You should totally go check out their website [http://www.html5quintus.com/](http://www.html5quintus.com/).

The game is designed to run on both desktops and mobile touchscreens.  This is because of the dual inputs.  It has touch inputs for a touchscreen, or if the player is on a desktop they can use the arrow keys.  Best of all, it is written entirely in javascript so that it will run in your webbrowser.  Check it out.
