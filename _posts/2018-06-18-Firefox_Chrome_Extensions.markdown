I just broke over 100 users for my Quick Bookmarks addon/extension when I realized that I have never posted about it before, so here it goes.  Quick Bookmarks is an add-on for Firefox and an extension for Chrome that allows the user to quickly access their favorite bookmarks, or to create a new bookmark.

I realized that there was 4 or 5 bookmarks that I would use all the time throughout the day (ie. Wikipedia), so I wanted a way to access it without having to move the mouse (which took time and effor).  So I knew with javascript that I could edit the user's context menu (the left click on the mouse) and I also knew that Firefox and Chrome extensions where written in javascript.  So I figured I would try to meld the two together.

I mostly just wanted to try making a browser extension.  This was my first extension and I'm very happy with how it turned out.  If you want to check it out, links are below.
