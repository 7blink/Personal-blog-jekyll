It has been a long time since I last posted, but I have been working on many projects that I can't wait to share with you.  

But in the mean time, I wanted to share my thoughts on the Microsoft acquisition of Github.  Microsoft makes great products and I'm excited to see how they will improve Github in the future.  This could mean integration with their Azure cloud infrastructure that could lead to one-click deployments.  I think this is amazing and will lead to features that we can't even imagine at this point in time.

However, I have always advocated for the use of free open source software (FOSS) whenever possible.  There are many features to FOSS that I enjoy, such as:
* Communities supporting legacy software
* Ability to change between operating systems without worry for compatibilty or license key
* Easy to implement new features by the community.

Because of this, I have decided to move my projects to Gitlab.  I will continue to update existing projects on Github, but will put new projects onto Gitlabs.
