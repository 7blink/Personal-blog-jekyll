I don't know if you have ever seen the Project Euler website, but if you haven't, you should totally go check it out.<br /><br>
Project Euler is a series of challenges that require not just programming skill, but also mathematical skills to solve the problems. Most of the problems would take way to long to brute force every combination, so one has to try and come up with the most effient program to solve the problem.<br><br>
I have been working through some of them and have recently added them to my github repo.  Checkitout at https://github.com/7blink/ProjectEuler

I really like that the programs have to be effient in order to get a result in a quick amount of time.  Sure, some of the challenges are just puzzles for the programmer, but most require more than just brute forcing a solution.  That forces the programmer to think about where clock cycles are being wasted and how to better create the program.  

For the challenges, check out https://projecteuler.net/archives

and to check the solutions, check out https://code.google.com/p/projecteuler-solutions/wiki/ProjectEulerSolutions
