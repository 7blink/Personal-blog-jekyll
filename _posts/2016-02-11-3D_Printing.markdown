These are some small 3d printed pieces that I made.  I recently had some time to experiment with a 3d printer and I have been liking what I can do with it.  All the pieces are from www.thingiverse.com and I can imagine it took the creators some time to make them.  

The first piece is a minion holding a heart for Valentine's Day.  The second piece is a blue spinning top that comes in two pieces and gets glued together.  The third is a Munchkin counter for the card game Munchkin.

If you have never played the game before, the object is to move through the levels from level 1 through level 10.  The counter is a simple alternative to bringing the game board with you.  It was 3d printed in two pieces and then snapped together.
