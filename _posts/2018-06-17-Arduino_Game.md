This is a game I made back in May of 2016 and haven't had time to post until now.  It is an arduino version of the game "Simon", in which the player has to match a pattern given.  If the player is correct, an additional item is added to the sequence until the player loses.  

I made this to experiment with the button debounce function on the arduino.  If you are interested, all the code and schematics are available at https://github.com/7blink/arduino
